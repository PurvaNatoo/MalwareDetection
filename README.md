# Malware Detection
This project demontsrates using images of binary executables to detect if these files are malware files or not. For malware detection, two models have been developed, Convolutional Neural Network and SVM with HOG.

## OpCode Images

To generate image files from the Ponzi scheme opcode data:
- Use a terminal to navigate to root directory when the file `main.py` is located; within this project
- Run the command `python main.py opcode`
  - This command assumes that the directory `opcode` is in the same directory as the file `main.py`
  - If these two are in different directories, prepend the paths to the files in the command above

The images will be generated with the opcode file names as the prefixes
